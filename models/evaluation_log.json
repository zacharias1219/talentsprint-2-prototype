    "candidate": "The tax allocation for a business asset transfer depends on several factors such as the value of the transferred assets and their respective depreciation schedules. In general, if the total cost of acquiring the new assets exceeds the fair market value of the existing ones, then the excess would be allocated to the acquired assets. However, in some cases, where the fair market value of the assets is less than the purchase price, it may not make sense to allocate any portion of the acquisition costs to the acquired assets. This decision should be based on the overall economic benefits that accrue from the transaction, including increased productivity, improved efficiency, and enhanced profitability. Ultimately, the choice of allocating taxes will depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the business asset transfer, and it's always best to consult with professional advisors who can help guide you through this process.",

I am pleased to provide guidance and assistance in this matter.\n\nUnder Section 132 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), there is no specific deduction available for family health care expenses. However, some employers may offer their employees health insurance coverage that includes family health care benefits. If so, these expenses can be claimed as a tax deduction by filing Form 8965 with your income tax return. This form allows individuals to claim up to $4,050 per year for qualified medical expenses.\n\nIn order to qualify for this deduction, the employee must meet certain requirements such as being employed full-time and having worked at least 1,000 hours during the previous calendar year. The amount claimed will depend on various factors including the type of plan offered and the cost of the premium. It's essential to consult with your accountant or tax advisor to determine if this option would work best for you and your family.\n\nIf you have any questions about how to file Form 8965 or other related matters, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me directly. My contact information is provided below. Thank you again for considering my services, and I look forward to assisting you further. Best regards,\n[",

However, depending on your volume of operations, they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions. For corporations, you cannot use a personal account since the corporation is a separate legal entity that owns the funds. Also, you're generally required to separate corporate and personal funds to keep the limited liability protection (which is why you have the corporation to begin with). Generally, business accounts have much higher volumes and much more transactions than personal accounts, and it costs more for the banks to run them. In the US, some banks offer free, or very low-cost, business accounts for small businesses that don't need too many transactions. I'm sure if you shop around, you'll find those in Canada as well.",

Personal bank accounts can be used by individuals and families only, while business bank accounts provide various services such as cash management, debit cards, online bill payments, etc., which help in streamlining operations and improving efficiency. Additionally, having a separate business bank account helps with tax reporting, reducing paperwork, and providing access to specialized services like credit card processing and merchant services. Overall, it's essential for small businesses to maintain a separate business bank account to avoid any potential issues related to fraudulent activities, regulatory requirements, and other risks that may arise from operating under a single personal bank account.",

This would still put you down at 44% (effectively taking the whole 5% from you) but by giving some of your share to someone else, it does require your partner to make some of the sacrifice, while still benefiting someone you care about (if you have someone you would like to give that benefit to).

By doing so, these women can retain complete control over their company's operations and decision making processes without sacrificing their ability to make critical decisions about their businesses.

For example, if your business received income, where did that money go?  If you took the money personally, it would be considered either a 'distribution' or a 'loan' to you.  It is up to you which of the two options you choose. On the flip side, if your business had an expense that you paid personally, that would be considered either a 'contribution of capital' or a 'loan' from you. If you choose to record these transactions as loans, you can offset them together, so you don't need two separate accounts, loan to you and loan from you. When the bank account was opened, the initial deposit came from where?  If it came from your personal funds, then it is either a 'contribution of capital' or a 'loan' from you. From the sound of your question, you deposited what remained after the preceding income/expenses.  This would, in effect, return the 'loan' account back to zero, if choosing that route. The above would also be how to record any expenses you may pay personally for the business (if any) in the future. Because these transactions were not through a dedicated business bank account, you can't record them in Quickbooks as checks and deposits.  Instead, you can use Journal Entries.  For any income received, you would debit your capital/loan account and credit your income account.  For any expenses, you would debit the appropriate expense account and credit your distribution/loan account. Also, if setting up a loan account, you should choose either Current Asset or Current Liability type.  The capital contribution and distribution account should be Equity type. Hope this helps!",

Keep track of all income sources: Before opening a business bank account, keep track of all income sources such as salary, freelance work, side hustles, etc., that come in through direct deposit or paychecks. This will help you determine if there is any excess cash flow that needs to be saved up for expenses like rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance premiums, etc.\n\n2. Determine how much you need to save each month: Once you have identified your income sources, calculate how much you need to save every month based on your projected expenses. For example, let's say you expect to spend $500 per month on rent/mortgage, $300 on utilities, and $400 on groceries. Divide this amount by 6 months (or however long it takes to save up for those expenses) to get the total amount needed to save each month.\n\n3. Open a separate savings account: Create a new savings account specifically designated for saving towards these expenses. Make sure it has a high interest rate so you don't miss out on earning more than what you put into it.\n\n4. Use automated bill reminders: Set up automatic bill pay",
